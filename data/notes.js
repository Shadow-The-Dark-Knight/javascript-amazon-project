// id is useful bc you (normailize the data)
//JSON.stringify convert things to strings
// as localStorage can only be used when it has a string

//JSON.parse is used when using getItem while JSON.stringify
// is used for setItem
// if have problems and code looks good use localStorage.clear() 
//then refresh page.

// function insdie a object = method

////// object orientation programming = oragnize code into objects /////
// for things that generate objects use PascalCase

// const cart = new Cart();
// const businessCart = new Cart();

// instane of a class
// private property #localStorageKey

// super called parent class of constructor so you don't have to repeat code

// overide method by having extaInfoHTML in childs class and put '' in parents
// look at 

// polymorphism use a method without knowing a class
